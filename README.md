## Task Wizard Frontend

This repo is a frontend for [tasks-backend](https://github.com/dkhalife/tasks-backend), a free and open source solution for task management. It started as a fork of [DoneTick](https://github.com/donetick/frontend) but has since diverged from the original source code in order to accomplish different goals. Kudos to the contributors of [DoneTick](https://github.com/donetick/frontend) for helping kickstart this project.

## Goals and principles

Task Wizard's primary goal is to allow users to own and protect their data and the following principles are ways to accomplish that:

* All the user data sent by this frontend only ever goes to a single backend
* ðŸ”œ When data is cached on the local machine, it is encrypted with a user key
* The repo uses TypeScript with a strict set of rules designed to reduce bugs closest to development
* The code is continously scanned by a CI that runs CodeQL
* Dependencies are kept to a minimum
* When vulnerabilities are detected in dependencies they are auto updated with Dependabot

## Installation

This app is meant to be self-hosted by individuals and groups who wish to own their data and those who prioritize their data privacy. For setup instructions check out the [tasks-backend](https://github.com/dkhalife/tasks-backend) README.

## Development

1. Ensure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) 20+ installed
1. Clone the repository:
1. Navigate to the project directory: `cd path/to/cloned/repo`
1. Download dependency `yarn install`
1. Run locally `yarn start`. The output will contain instructions on how to browse the frontend.
1. Separately run the backend using instructions from [tasks-backend](https://github.com/dkhalife/tasks-backend)
1. (optionally) If using a different host for the backend, update `VITE_API_URL` in [.env](./.env)
